# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends. 
At the request of a client, analysis was performed on Kickstarter data to help determine the correct steps needed to successfully fund a play. 
The esitmate funding needed for the play is more than $10,000. 
Using data directly from Kickstarter, a website used to publically fund any type of business venture from starting a food truck, publishing a book, or performing a play, we began by cleaning up the data and filtering out any information not related to funding a play.
